This is an implementation of RedBeard Treasure Hunt game. You are to nagivate the seas to find your treasure. A navigable square is denoted by (".") and a non-navigable square denoted by ("+"). You can only use your sonar a number of times before it runs out of battery. Once you drop the sonar from your current position, your computer will search for the closest path to the treasure if and only if it is within your sonar's range. If your sonar does not detect a treasure, you may navigate N, S, E, W, and their allowable combinations. If you run out of battery for your sonar device, you lose the game.

Here is an example of finding the treasure! The ("*") denotes the shortest navigable path to a Treasure.
